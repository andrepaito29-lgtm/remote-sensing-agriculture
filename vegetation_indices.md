# Vegetation Indices and Crop Monitoring

This repository includes basic examples and documentation related to vegetation indices used in precision agriculture and environmental monitoring.

## NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
NDVI is used to assess vegetation vigor, photosynthetic activity, and general crop health using red and near-infrared bands.

## Applications
- Crop health assessment
- Phenological stage analysis
- Stress detection (biotic and abiotic)
- UAV-based agricultural monitoring

These methods are commonly applied in crops such as pitahaya, oil palm, and forest plantations.
